# Wired Brain Project ft Pluralsight
A React Native app per Pluralsight course by Roland Guijt. [Here is the actual project's repo](https://github.com/RolandGuijt/ps-chat-app-reactnative).

These files may look a little different. To use them:

1. First start with Roland's actual work (before code) - give the actual course a look too if you can
2. Replace the project's relevant files with these ones (no major differences with after code)
3. Run `npm i`
4. Open an Android emulator or get your device ready
5. Run `npm run android`
